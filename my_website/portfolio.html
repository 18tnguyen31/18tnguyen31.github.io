    <h3 class="Port">Game Reflection</h3>
    <p>The purpose of my game is to score as many points as possible, and points are earned by <br>
    accurately pressing on the corresponding arrows to when the guitars hit the "scoring row." <br>
    To make my game, I started off with the technique to score points. It began with how the guitars <br>
    would move upward, and it progressed to the points which would be added. When start is received, the <br>
    guitars will return to their original position then glide upward in the time determined by the difficulty. <br>
    To score, the player would have to have the correct arrow key pressed when the moving guitars are touching <br>
    the stationary ones. If the key is correctly pressed, the score is changed by +10. When it's pressed and not <br>
    touching, it would subtract 5 from the score. The most difficult thing about my game was moving the guitars. <br>
    I solved this issue by "taking inspiration" from another game. I had an opportunity to make a dank ending <br>
    screen so I used presidents :/

    <h3 class= "Port">Quick Summary</h3>
    <p>Happy Timmy is about a happy boy who gets a good SAT score. He has the choice to go to college or take<br>
    a gap year but no matter what happens, there's a sad ending.<br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="Port">Story Reflection</h3>
    <p>To produce this story, the basic programming concepts we needed were if else statements, making<br>
    functions, comparisons, and calling forth other functions. At first, we made a very long and complicated<br>
    if-else statement with multiple if-else statements inside, however it just got too confusing. With some<br>
    help from Ms. Terry, we found out that you can just make a bunch of functions and call<br>
    them based off of an input. I'm kind of proud of this story, because it seemed to get<br>
    a great reaction based on the turn of events. The title is pretty ironic and the whole idea of things<br>
    ending badly kind of reminds me of Game of Thrones, which I happen to love.<br>
    A story which I particularly liked was "Watch Out Watch Out Watch Out!!" because your demise mainly<br>
    comes from an RKO. If I were to redo this story, I would add more decision points and make more<br>
    of a lengthy story. I interpretted this assignment as more of a short story and some took it as writing<br>
    a book. I'd like to have made a better medium, where the story is not super short or super long.
