    <p>The purpose of my game is to score as many points as possible, and points are earned by <br>
    accurately pressing on the corresponding arrows to when the guitars hit the "scoring row." <br>
    To make my game, I started off with the technique to score points. It began with how the guitars <br>
    would move upward, and it progressed to the points which would be added. When start is received, the <br>
    guitars will return to their original position then glide upward in the time determined by the difficulty. <br>
    To score, the player would have to have the correct arrow key pressed when the moving guitars are touching <br>
    the stationary ones. If the key is correctly pressed, the score is changed by +10. When it's pressed and not <br>
    touching, it would subtract 5 from the score. The most difficult thing about my game was moving the guitars. <br>
    I solved this issue by "taking inspiration" from another game. I had an opportunity to make a dank ending <br>
    screen so I used presidents :/
